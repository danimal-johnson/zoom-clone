# Zoom Video Conference Clone

Well, maybe not an actual clone of the much more sophisticated Zoom, but still a functional example of videoconferencing using WebRTC.

Based on a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvlyzDZDEq4) by Kyle at Web Dev Simplified.

## Key tech
* WebRTC (Real Time Communications)
* Socket.io
* [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com)
* EJS (Embedded JavaScript)
* NodeJS
* Express
* UUID

To use PeerJS, install it globally with `npm i -g peer` and run it in a separate terminal with `peerjs --port 3001`
